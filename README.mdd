## Summary

This repository contains the computational evidence, datasets, and work-in-progress note showing that within the bounds N ≤ 10⁸, the only square-free Carmichael number that admits two distinct unordered positive two-cube representations is **1729**.

**Method:**  
1) enumerate all N ≤ 10⁸ with ≥2 unordered positive two-cube representations  
2) filter for Carmichael numbers using Korselt’s criterion  
Only **1729** survives both constraints.

Artifacts included in this repository:
- PDF note (Draft 0.5)  
- CSV: multi two-cube candidates ≤ 10⁸  
- CSV: Carmichael subset among them

This repository serves as a public timestamped record of this micro-domain result.
